# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first post using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), a powerful open-source scientific and technical publishing system.

## What is Quarto?

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. It's perfect for:

- **Technical writing** with code examples
- **Scientific papers** with reproducible results
- **Data analysis** with interactive visualizations
- **Blogs** like this one!

## Features of This Blog

This blog includes:

- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Beautiful typography using Inter font
- Dark mode support
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Mathematical equations with KaTeX
- Interactive visualizations

## Getting Started

To get started with Quarto, you can:

1. Install Quarto from [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/docs/download/)
2. Create a new project with `quarto create-project`
3. Write your content in `.qmd` files
4. Publish with `quarto publish`

## Code Example

Here's a simple Python example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Sine Wave')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('sin(x)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
