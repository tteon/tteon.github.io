Our focus on Developer Experience (DX) ensures that integrating state-of-the-art AI models is as simple as a few lines of code.\n\n\n🌐 Knowledge\nWe believe in the power of Knowledge Graphs. By structuring unstructured data, we unlock new capabilities for LLMs (RAG) and decision-making systems.\n\n\n🛡️ Privacy\nPrivacy by design. Our local-first approach ensures that sensitive data never leaves your infrastructure unless you explicitly want it to.\n\n\n🤝 Community\nOpen source is about people. We are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive community where everyone can learn and contribute."
