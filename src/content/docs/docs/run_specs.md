`seocho run` executes one end-to-end flow — index documents, ask questions,
write a report — from a single YAML file. A run spec is the run-scoped layer
on top of the existing design dialects:

- run-scoped vocabulary (models, graph connection, inputs, output) lives here
- agent behavior is delegated to [agent design specs](https://github.com/tteon/seocho/blob/main/docs/AGENT_DESIGN_SPECS.md)
- ingestion behavior is delegated to [indexing design specs](https://github.com/tteon/seocho/blob/main/docs/INDEXING_DESIGN_SPECS.md)

A run spec never redefines a key those dialects already own; it references or
embeds their documents.

## At A Glance

Use this page when you want a reproducible run instead of one-off Python code.

| Reader task | Section to read | Output |
|---|---|---|
| create the first YAML file | [Quickstart](#quickstart) and [Minimal spec](#minimal-spec) | `seocho.run.yaml` |
| understand all supported fields | [Full spec](#full-spec) | a complete run config |
| choose ontology strictness | [Ontology enforcement](#ontology-enforcement) | `strict`, `guided`, or `open` |
| compare multiple variants | [Templates and sweeps](#templates-and-sweeps) | one comparison report |
| debug a failed run | [CLI](#cli) and [Report](#report) | preflight errors and `report.md` |

The short mental model:

| File | Job |
|---|---|
| `seocho.run.yaml` | one resolved run: index, query, report |
| `run.yaml.j2` | a template for multiple variants |
| `seocho.sweep.yaml` | the list of variants to render and compare |

## Running the CLI

SEOCHO standardizes on [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). From a repo checkout,
prefix every command with `uv run` — uv resolves the project environment and
syncs dependencies, so there is no venv to activate:

```bash
uv run seocho run …
uv run seocho sweep …
```

If you installed SEOCHO into your own environment instead (`uv pip install
seocho`), drop the prefix and call `seocho …` directly. The examples below use
the bare `seocho` form for brevity; prepend `uv run` when working from a clone.

## Quickstart

```bash
uv run seocho run --init    # writes a commented seocho.run.yaml template
# edit ontology/documents/questions, then:
uv run seocho run           # or: uv run seocho run path/to/config.yaml
```

A working example ships in the repo:

```bash
export MARA_API_KEY=...
uv run seocho run examples/run/quickstart.yaml
```

## Minimal spec

With no graph server and no model keys beyond one provider env var:

```yaml
ontology: ./schema.yaml
documents: ./docs/
questions:
  - Which companies reported revenue growth?
  - Who is the CEO of Acme?
```

Defaults: `mara/MiniMax-M2.5` for both phases, embedded LadybugDB
(`.seocho/local.lbug`), `guided` enforcement, `pipeline` execution mode.

## Full spec

The full spec has five practical blocks:

| Block | Controls | Usually start with |
|---|---|---|
| `ontology` | schema source and enforcement policy | `path` + `enforcement: guided` |
| `documents` | files or records to index | `path` + `recursive: true` |
| `models` | model used for indexing and querying | `default` |
| `graph` / `vector` | storage backend | omit for embedded LadybugDB |
| `query` / `questions` / `output` | questions and report location | one or more `questions` |

```yaml
name: filings-demo                  # default: config filename stem
description: Optional free text.

ontology:
  path: ./schema.yaml               # YAML / JSON-LD / TTL (Ontology.load)
  enforcement: guided               # strict | guided | open (default: guided)

documents:
  path: ./docs/                     # .txt .md .csv .json .jsonl .pdf
  recursive: true

models:
  default: mara/MiniMax-M2.5        # provider/model for both phases
  indexing: mara/MiniMax-M2         # per-phase override → separate client
  query: mara/MiniMax-M2.5

graph: bolt://localhost:7687        # omit for embedded LadybugDB
graph_user: neo4j
graph_password: ${NEO4J_PASSWORD:-password}
database: neo4j                     # omit to derive from the ontology name
workspace_id: filings_demo          # default: derived from name

# graph also accepts a mapping with an explicit backend kind:
# graph:
#   kind: dozerdb                   # neo4j | dozerdb | ladybug
#   uri: bolt://localhost:7687      # ladybug uses `path:` instead
#   user: neo4j
#   password: ${NEO4J_PASSWORD}
#   database: mydb

vector:                             # optional hybrid-search vector store
  kind: faiss                       # faiss (in-memory) | lancedb (on-disk)
  embedding: fastembed              # local bge (default, no network) or an
                                    #   LLM provider preset (mara, openai, ...)
  # embedding_model: BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5
  # uri: ./.lancedb                 # lancedb only
  # table_name: seocho_vectors      # lancedb only

indexing:
  design: ./indexing_design.yaml    # optional IndexingDesignSpec (path or inline)
  category: filing
  force: false

agent:
  design: ./agent_design.yaml       # optional AgentDesignSpec (path or inline)
  execution_mode: pipeline          # pipeline | agent | supervisor
  routing_policy: balanced          # fast | balanced | thorough

query:
  reasoning_mode: true
  repair_budget: 1
  answer_style: concise             # concise | evidence | table
  limit: 5

questions:                          # strings, or mappings with expectations
  - Which companies reported revenue growth?
  - question: Who is the CEO of Acme?
    expect: Jane Park               # recorded in the report, not auto-graded
    id: ceo-check

output:
  dir: runs                         # report lands in runs/<name>-<timestamp>/
```

Omitting `questions` entirely makes the run index-only.

## Ontology enforcement

`ontology.enforcement` declares the admission policy for extracted graph
data against the ontology vocabulary:

| Mode | Use it when | Write behavior | Failure behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `strict` | the graph must stay inside a closed vocabulary | reject invalid chunks | empty extraction is allowed; `validation_on_fail` defaults to `reject` |
| `guided` | you want the default product behavior | write content and report validation errors | relaxed retry and `Entity` fallback remain available |
| `open` | you are discovering a new ontology | write content and mark out-of-vocabulary facts | `validation_on_fail: reject` is incoherent |

Implementation notes:

- `strict` disables relaxed retry and heuristic fallbacks.
- `strict` validates dangling endpoints and domain/range conformance through
  the broader chain.
- `open` stamps out-of-vocabulary nodes and relationships with
  `_out_of_ontology: "true"` for later governance review.
- These modes are admission policies for extracted data, not CWA/OWA inference
  semantics. Query-time entailment is unchanged.

## Domain-adaptive guardrail selection

Instead of a fixed `ontology.path`, a run can declare `ontology.select` to let
SEOCHO pick the best guardrail ontology for the target corpus (ADR-0123). The
runner scores each candidate against the corpus profile with the corpus-aware
scorecard and chooses — richest-adequate for entity/qualitative corpora, leanest
for numeric corpora (where vocabulary enrichment does not improve answers,
ADR-0122):

```yaml
ontology:
  select:
    candidates:
      lean: ./fibo_minus.jsonld
      rich: ./fibo_plus.jsonld
    corpus_profile: ./corpus_profile.json   # {label: freq} or build_corpus_profile output
  enforcement: guided
```

Candidates can instead be built automatically from a compiled FIBO catalog
(ADR-0142): `select.fibo.catalog` points at `catalog.json`; each module is
corpus-bridged (lexical + semantic) and the best is chosen. `bridge: stable`
derives a multi-model auto seed (uses the MARA provider — ADR-0140);
`bridge: lexical` stays offline. The chosen guardrail is held in memory
(version-pinned to the FIBO commit), no file needed.

```yaml
ontology:
  select:
    fibo:
      catalog: ./outputs/semantic_artifacts/fibo/latest/catalog.json
      modules: [BE, FBC, FND, SEC]   # omit → all modules
      bridge: stable                 # stable (multi-model auto seed) | lexical (offline)
      derive_models: [DeepSeek-V3.1, MiniMax-M2.5, gpt-oss-120b]
    corpus_profile: ./corpus_profile.json
  enforcement: guided
```

The corpus profile comes from an open (ontology-free) extraction over the corpus
(`seocho.ontology_scorecard.build_corpus_profile`). At run time the chosen
ontology is logged (`[guardrail] selected '<name>' …`) and recorded on the run.
Provide either `ontology.path` (fixed) or `ontology.select` — not neither.

The enforcement policy is compiled by `seocho.EnforcementPolicy` from
`AgentConfig.ontology_enforcement`; agent design specs may declare
`ontology.enforcement` too, and an explicit run-spec value overrides the
design (the implicit `guided` default never does). These are admission
policies for extracted data — not CWA/OWA inference semantics; query-time
entailment is unchanged in every mode.

## Storage backends

The graph store is selected by `graph.kind` (or inferred from a bare
string: bolt-scheme URI → Neo4j/DozerDB, anything else → embedded
LadybugDB path). The optional `vector:` section adds a hybrid-search
vector store (`Seocho(vector_store=...)` / `search_similar()`):

| Backend | Key | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LadybugDB (embedded) | `graph.kind: ladybug` / blank | zero-infra default; one file = one graph |
| Neo4j / DozerDB | `graph.kind: neo4j\|dozerdb` + `uri:` | per-`database` isolation on one server |
| FAISS (vector) | `vector.kind: faiss` | in-memory, rebuilt per run |
| LanceDB (vector) | `vector.kind: lancedb` + `uri:` | on-disk; sweeps isolate the uri per variant |

`vector.embedding` defaults to `fastembed` (local bge, no network, 384-dim
auto-derived); set it to a provider preset (`mara`, `openai`, ...) for
HTTP embeddings. RDBMS backends are not supported — the SDK's `GraphStore`
contract has no relational implementation today.

In sweeps, on-disk vector stores get the same isolation as embedded
graphs (blank lancedb `uri` → `<sweep>/<variant>/vectors.lancedb`), and a
bolt graph shared by multiple variants prints a note that isolation rides
on per-variant database/workspace only.

## Per-phase models

When `models.indexing` and `models.query` differ, the runner builds two
clients sharing one graph store, ontology, and workspace — per-phase model
separation without per-call plumbing. Env-driven routing
(`SEOCHO_MODEL_ROUTING`) still applies within each phase if configured.

## Environment variables in values

Any string value may interpolate `${VAR}` or `${VAR:-default}`. An unset
variable without a default is a config error. Put env var *names* in YAML,
never literal API keys; provider keys are read from the provider's standard
env var (`MARA_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, ...).

## CLI

```
seocho run [CONFIG] [options]

  CONFIG            Run spec YAML, or a Jinja2 template (*.yaml.j2)
  --init            Write a commented template and exit (refuses to overwrite)
  --dry-run         Validate config + offline preflight; no LLM calls
  --only index|query  Run a single phase (query reuses the existing graph)
  --var KEY=VALUE   Template variable (*.j2 only; repeatable, dotted keys)
  --vars FILE       YAML file of template variables (repeatable)
  --show-rendered   Print the rendered YAML (pre-${ENV}) and exit
  -o, --output DIR  Report directory (default: runs/<name>-<timestamp>/)
  --force           Re-index files even if unchanged
  --output-json     Machine-readable output

Exit codes: 0 ok · 1 runtime/preflight failure · 2 invalid config
```

Every run starts with a preflight that reports **all** failing checks
(ontology loads, documents found, API key present, graph reachable) before
anything spends tokens. `--dry-run` is the same preflight without the graph
connection attempt.

## Report

Each run writes `report.json` (machine-readable: run metadata, per-file
indexing stats, per-question records with latency and errors) and
`report.md` (human summary) under `output.dir/<name>-<timestamp>/`. Empty
answers and per-question errors are surfaced in the summary table; a
question error marks the run as failed (exit 1) without aborting remaining
questions.

## Templates and sweeps

Doctrine:

- `run` — one resolved spec, one report. A spec may be a Jinja2 template;
  rendering produces the one spec.
- `sweep` — one template × N variable sets → N runs → one comparison summary.
- `experiment` — extraction-only micro-benchmark over a single text/dir
  (no query phase, no run reports).

### Two substitution layers

| Layer | Syntax | Resolved | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jinja2 | `{{ var }}`, `{% for %}` | authoring/render time, before YAML parse | parameters, variants, structure |
| Env | `${VAR}`, `${VAR:-default}` | load time, after rendering | secrets — never persisted into artifacts |

Rendering is decided by **file extension only** (`*.j2`); plain `.yaml`
configs never touch the template layer, so question text containing `{{`
stays untouched (use `{% raw %}` for literal braces inside templates).
Supplying `--var`/`--vars` for a non-template config is an error.

Authoring rule: **quote every string substitution** (`"{{ model }}"`),
**never quote numeric/boolean ones** (`{{ limit | default(5) }}`) — this
avoids YAML flow-mapping breakage and the Norway problem in one rule.

Variable precedence (low → high): template `| default(...)` < sweep `vars:`
< variant `vars:` < `--vars` files (in order) < `--var` flags. Mappings
deep-merge; scalars and lists are replaced. `--var` keys may be dotted
(`models.indexing=...`) and values are YAML-parsed (`limit=10` → int).
`variant` and `sweep` are reserved names — `seocho sweep` injects
`variant.name`, `variant.index`, and `sweep.name` per variant.

### Sweep file

```yaml
# seocho.sweep.yaml
name: enforcement-shootout      # default: filename stem
template: ./run.yaml.j2         # required; rendered once per variant
vars:                           # shared by every variant (optional)
  model: mara/MiniMax-M2.5
variants:                       # required, non-empty; unique names
  - name: guided
    vars: { enforcement: guided }
  - name: strict
    vars: { enforcement: strict }
output:
  dir: runs
```

```
seocho sweep [SWEEP] [options]

  SWEEP                  Sweep spec YAML (default: ./seocho.sweep.yaml)
  --init                 Write seocho.sweep.yaml + run.yaml.j2 and exit
  --dry-run              Render + validate every variant + offline preflight
  --show-rendered [NAME] Print rendered YAML (one variant, or all) and exit
  --only-variant NAME    Run a subset (repeatable)
  --var / --vars         Variable overrides applied to ALL variants
  --fail-fast            Stop at the first failed variant (default: keep going)
  -o, --output DIR       Sweep root (default: runs/<name>-<timestamp>/)

Exit codes: 0 all variants ok · 1 any variant failed · 2 config error
```

Config errors are collected across **all** variants up front and nothing
runs (exit 2); runtime failures keep going by default and the comparison
table marks them (exit 1).

### Variant isolation

Each variant is fully isolated, automatically:

- blank `graph:` → its own embedded store at `<sweep>/<variant>/graph.lbug`
  (one `.lbug` file is one graph — paths isolate, names do not);
- `bolt://` targets keep the URI but get a per-variant `database` when blank;
- `workspace_id` is **always** suffixed with the variant name — the response
  cache is keyed by workspace, so two variants differing only by model would
  otherwise serve each other's cached answers;
- `.seocho_index` change tracking is disabled (`track=False`), so variant
  N+1 never skips files as "unchanged" and your docs directory stays clean.

Variants run sequentially: the embedded store is a single-writer engine and
parallel variants would mostly time-slice the same LLM rate limit.

### Sweep artifacts

```
runs/<sweep-name>-<timestamp>/
  summary.json / summary.md     # comparison table + per-variant status
  <variant>/
    rendered.yaml               # resolved spec (pre-${ENV}, paths absolutized)
                                #   reproduce standalone: seocho run rendered.yaml
    report.json / report.md
    graph.lbug
```

[examples/run/sweep-enforcement/](../examples/run/sweep-enforcement/) —

enforcement, compared in one table.
