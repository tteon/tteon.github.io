This document defines when SEOCHO should cut a release, what evidence is needed
before publishing it, and how the `#seocho` Discord channel should support
real-time open-source operations without becoming the canonical changelog.

## Operating Principle

SEOCHO is still alpha software. Releases should be boring, evidence-backed, and
easy to audit. Discord can make the project feel alive, but GitHub and docs
remain the source of truth.

Canonical surfaces:

- GitHub Releases
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `README.md`, [`/docs/quickstart/`](/docs/quickstart/), and relevant `docs/*`
- issue and PR history

Broadcast surfaces:

- Discord `#seocho`
- docs/blog posts when a release deserves a narrative explanation

## Release Types

SEOCHO follows SemVer intent, with alpha discipline:

| Type | When to use | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Patch | Bug fix, docs correction, packaging fix, compatibility repair | dependency metadata, broken import, small query bug |
| Minor | Additive public SDK/runtime/docs capability without breaking existing users | connector surface, run-spec feature, public example |
| Major | Breaking public API, runtime contract, persisted data contract, or migration burden | renamed SDK facade, incompatible response shape, graph schema migration |
| Pre-release | Risky capability needing user feedback before stable release | `0.6.0rc1`, connector preview, distributed runtime preview |

No release should be cut only because a commit landed. Release when there is a
user-visible reason to update.

## Release Readiness Gates

Every release issue should state the intended version, release type, linked PRs,
and exact validation evidence.

Required for every release:

- `bash scripts/ci/run_basic_ci.sh`
- GitHub `Basic CI` green on the release commit
- `CHANGELOG.md` updated under the target version
- public docs updated for user-visible behavior
- release notes draft includes known gaps and skipped validation
- no public issue or PR marked release-blocking
- no new secret, local path, generated artifact, or private data committed

Required when touched:

| Touched surface | Additional gate |
|---|---|
| SDK facade, models, session, transport | SDK-focused tests and public docs wording |
| Runtime API, policy, memory service | runtime/extraction compatibility tests and `workspace_id` propagation check |
| Query, Graph-RAG, answer synthesis | query tests, Cypher guard coverage, and `docs/GRAPH_RAG_AGENT_HANDOFF_SPEC.md` review |
| Indexing, graph shaping, ontology enforcement | indexing tests, examples assumptions, ontology docs review |
| GitHub automation, scripts, repo layout | `bash scripts/ci/check-doc-contracts.sh` and `scripts/ci/check-root-hierarchy-contract.sh` |
| Performance or scalability claims | live-evidence report with service versions, dataset, concurrency, hardware/container limits, warmup, and skipped components |
| Security-sensitive behavior | private security review path; do not use public Discord for sensitive details |

## Release Blockers

Do not publish a stable release while any of these are true:

- basic CI is failing on the release commit
- release notes imply production readiness without live evidence
- `CHANGELOG.md` is missing or vague for user-visible behavior
- docs quickstart is stale for the default installation path
- a public API or response shape changed without tests and docs
- runtime-facing models lose `workspace_id` or policy checks
- release includes private local agent/editor state
- known security issue is being discussed in public instead of `SECURITY.md`

## Open-Source Readiness Gaps

Current readiness gaps to track before broader community growth:

- existing unlabeled backlog needs one-time label backfill
- CODEOWNERS is not defined yet
- release issue template exists, but release automation is still manual
- PyPI/TestPyPI publish workflow should be revisited before the next package release
- `SECURITY.md` claims need a follow-up audit against actual workflows
- contributor welcome/comment automation should wait until label quality is proven
- stale issue handling should start as a report, not an auto-closing bot
- Discord moderation and maintainer escalation rules are lightweight and should
  evolve with traffic

## `#seocho` Discord Channel

Use `#seocho` as the real-time open-source operating channel.

Good posts:

- release announcements and pre-release calls for testing
- manually curated update summaries
- weekly maintainer digest or roadmap summary
- `help wanted` and `good first issue` highlights
- design questions that need fast community feedback
- links to canonical GitHub issues, PRs, releases, and docs

Avoid:

- raw commit spam
- unverified performance claims
- sensitive security details
- private customer/user data
- decisions that exist only in Discord
- bot messages that mention users automatically

Tone:

- Korean-first is fine; include English technical keywords where useful
- keep posts short, link to GitHub for details
- state evidence plainly: command, commit, run URL, release tag
- say `gap` when validation did not run

## Discord Message Classes

| Class | Trigger | Owner | Discord shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| Release | GitHub release is published | maintainer + GitHub Actions | release title, bullets, link |
| Manual update | Maintainer dispatches `Discord Updates` | maintainer | curated one-off update |
| Weekly digest | weekly or manual | Knowledge OS / `agy` | curated summary, roadmap, help wanted |
| Incident/security | private report or high-severity issue | maintainer | public acknowledgement only after safe disclosure |
| Call for contributors | maintainer-curated issue batch | maintainer or `agy` draft | 3-5 issues with labels and links |

## Knowledge OS And `agy`

`agy` should use Discord as a real-time community channel, but not as a database.
The Knowledge OS side should draft and archive higher-context summaries in
Obsidian, then optionally post selected summaries.

Expected Knowledge OS responsibilities:

- monitor `Discord Updates` workflow health
- include release readiness in daily/weekly SEOCHO digests
- draft weekly Discord summaries from GitHub evidence
- draft release notes before maintainers publish a GitHub release
- track unresolved readiness gaps as issues or Obsidian tasks

Default mode for `agy`: draft first, then post only when the cadence and tone
are reviewed.

## Release Checklist Issue

Use GitHub's `Release checklist` issue template for every stable or pre-release
candidate. The issue should remain open until:

- release tag exists
- GitHub Release is published
- Discord announcement has been sent
- follow-up gaps are converted into issues or docs tasks

## Suggested Cadence

- Patch: as needed when a bug materially blocks users
- Minor: no more than weekly while alpha unless there is a clear adoption reason
- Pre-release: for connector/runtime/distributed features before broad docs claims
- Weekly Discord digest: start as draft-only; enable posting after two useful drafts

## Maintainer TODO

- backfill labels for old issues and PRs
- create a release-blocking label if release issues begin to accumulate
- decide whether package publishing should use manual `uv build`/`twine` or a
  GitHub Actions release workflow
- add CODEOWNERS after ownership is clear
- audit `SECURITY.md` and align it with actual workflows
