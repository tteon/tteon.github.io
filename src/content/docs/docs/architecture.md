## Overview

SEOCHO transforms unstructured data into structured Knowledge Graphs. It implements an asynchronous, dynamic Agent Pool architecture leveraging a **Parallel Debate** pattern to answer complex queries against dynamically provisioned graph targets.

Current baseline:

- Agent runtime: OpenAI Agents SDK
- Trace/evaluation contract: vendor-neutral (`none|console|jsonl|opik`)
- Preferred team backend: Opik
- Canonical neutral artifact: JSONL
- Graph backend: DozerDB (Neo4j protocol compatible)

## Local Runtime Shape

Default local activation is intentionally smaller than the full historical repo:

- `neo4j`
- `extraction-service`
- `evaluation-interface`

This is the supported first-run path for developers.
The old `semantic-service` still exists, but only behind the explicit compose
profile:

```bash
docker compose --profile legacy-semantic up -d semantic-service
```

That distinction matters because most current onboarding, API verification, and
platform UX flow through `extraction-service`, not the standalone legacy
semantic container.

During the staged runtime rename, `extraction-service` still starts the legacy
flat `agent_server` module. Compose therefore bind-mounts `runtime/` and
`seocho/` into `/app`, and the flat `extraction/*` compatibility aliases
bootstrap repo-root imports before delegating to canonical `runtime/*` modules.
This keeps the local activation path stable while ownership moves out of the
historically overloaded package.

## Storage And Artifact Layout

The main local artifacts are deliberately file-system visible:

- ontology contract: usually `schema.jsonld`
- graph state for the local compose stack: `data/neo4j/`
- semantic artifacts: `outputs/semantic_artifacts/`
- rule profile registry: `outputs/rule_profiles/rule_profiles.db`
- semantic run metadata: `outputs/semantic_metadata/`
- traces: path from `SEOCHO_TRACE_JSONL_PATH`

Operators should inspect these directly during debugging instead of treating the
runtime as opaque. See [`/docs/files_and_artifacts/`](/docs/files_and_artifacts/) for the concrete commands.

## Priority Execution Board (2026-02-21)

This board is the active architecture priority order.

### P0: Runtime Contract Stability

- isolate OpenAI Agents SDK calls behind one adapter layer
- enforce contract tests for runner signatures and response payload shape
- block release when strict runtime e2e smoke fails

### P0: Real-Database Agent Provisioning

- only create debate agents for databases that actually exist and are reachable
- expose degraded/partial state in runtime payload when some DB agents are skipped
- keep routing safe when registry includes stale DB names

### P1: Graph Query Durability

- migrate `id(node)` usage to `elementId(node)` contract-safe path
- validate query templates against DozerDB/Neo4j deprecation warnings
  - status: semantic query flow path migrated to `elementId` contract

### P1: Process Isolation and Health Model

- separate runtime API readiness from batch/notebook pipeline readiness
- split health checks and operational alerts by service role
  - status: `/health/runtime` and `/health/batch` endpoints added

### P1: Agent Readiness State Machine

- define `ready | degraded | blocked` for each graph agent
- make router/supervisor allocate requests using readiness metadata
  - status: debate runtime emits readiness state and platform fallback on `blocked`

### P2: Governance Automation

- enforce `/rules/assess` as promotion gate for rule profile rollout
- expand CI integration checks for ontology artifact and rule export paths

## User Activation Critical Path

Architecture changes are not complete unless users can run this path directly:

1. ingest raw data via `/platform/ingest/raw`
2. ensure semantic index via `/indexes/fulltext/ensure`
3. ask semantic/debate questions via `/api/chat/send`
4. inspect trace and runtime payload in UI
5. pass `make e2e-smoke`

This critical path is the default acceptance gate for user-facing releases.

## Control Plane vs Data Plane

### Control Plane

- agent orchestration and routing policies
- runtime authorization policy enforcement
- deployment quality gates and ADR governance

Canonical SDK control-plane modules:

- `seocho/agent/`
- `seocho/query/`
- `seocho/http_transport.py`
- `seocho/ontology.py` as the stable public ontology facade
- `seocho/ontology_context.py` for compact shared ontology context descriptors and cache
- `seocho/ontology_serialization.py` for JSON-LD persistence
- `seocho/ontology_artifacts.py` for runtime artifact and typed prompt generation
- `seocho/ontology_governance.py` for offline diff/check/export flows
- `seocho/runtime_contract.py`

Primary modules:

- `runtime/agent_server.py`
- `runtime/server_runtime.py`
- `runtime/policy.py`
- `docs/decisions/`

## Runtime Package Target (Active Direction)

`extraction/` is a historical package name, not the desired long-term runtime
name.

Long-term package shape:

- `seocho/`
  - canonical engine modules
- `runtime/`
  - deployment shell, route wiring, policy, readiness, registry
- `extraction/`
  - extraction-only helpers or compatibility wrappers during migration

We are intentionally choosing `runtime/` over `server/` because the shell owns
more than HTTP route files. The staged migration contract lives in
`docs/RUNTIME_PACKAGE_MIGRATION.md`. Contributor-facing placement guidance
lives in `docs/MODULE_OWNERSHIP_MAP.md`.

## Internal Orchestration Seams (2026-04-17)

`ADR-0080` introduced internal seams for the modular monolith. The important
question now is where those seams are actually in use.

Current wiring:

- local SDK ingest path: `Seocho.add()` -> `seocho/local_engine._LocalEngine`
  -> `seocho.index.ingestion_facade.IngestionFacade` -> `seocho.index.pipeline.IndexingPipeline`
- runtime semantic composition root: `runtime/server_runtime.py` now builds the
  shared `SemanticAgentFlow` through the canonical `seocho.query.AgentFactory`
- runtime graph reads: `runtime/memory_service.py` and runtime Cypher tool
  execution now route read queries through `seocho.query.QueryProxy`
  - `QueryProxy` now owns the typed query-result contract so runtime and
    semantic paths can distinguish empty results from connector/contract failures
- runtime readiness model: `runtime.agent_readiness.summarize_readiness()`
  normalizes debate availability onto `runtime.agent_state.AgentStateMachine`

Explicit non-goal for this slice:

- the legacy debate specialist-agent factory in `extraction/agent_factory.py`
  is still in place. That path remains compatible, but it is not yet the
  canonical factory seam.

## Ontology Module Boundaries (Active Direction)

Ontology remains a first-class SDK primitive, but it should no longer behave as
one monolithic implementation file.

- `seocho/ontology.py`
  - stable public `Ontology`, `NodeDef`, `RelDef`, and `P` surface
  - schema validation, SHACL derivation, and prompt-facing API entrypoints
- `seocho/ontology_context.py`
  - stable `ontology_context_hash` descriptor shared by indexing, query, traces, and agent sessions
  - small in-process cache for compiled extraction/query/agent context artifacts
  - SKOS-style glossary/vocabulary hash derived from ontology labels, aliases, properties, and relationship terms
  - graph-write metadata helpers that attach compact `_ontology_*` properties to persisted nodes and relationships
  - query guardrail helpers that compare active ontology context with indexed graph context hashes
  - typed HTTP response metadata for memory search/chat, semantic query, router, debate, execution-plan, and platform chat clients
- Target middleware contract: `docs/ONTOLOGY_RUN_CONTEXT_STRATEGY.md`
  - aligns workspace, graph/database scope, ontology profile, glossary identity, policy, tool use, debate, session carryover, and evidence status
- Target property-graph lens contract: `docs/PROPERTY_GRAPH_LENS_STRATEGY.md`
  - preserves schemaless graph flexibility while marking only agent-visible anchors, evidence sources, evidence paths, provenance, importance, confidence, and context metadata
- `seocho/ontology_serialization.py`
  - canonical JSON-LD load/save helpers
  - no runtime governance side effects
- `seocho/ontology_artifacts.py`
  - runtime-facing typed artifact promotion
  - approved artifacts, semantic prompt context, vocabulary shaping
- `seocho/ontology_governance.py`
  - offline check/diff/export/OWL inspection path

Canonical direction:

- local SDK and runtime promotion paths should consume explicit ontology-side
  contracts instead of hand-built client glue
- public API compatibility should stay centered on `Ontology`
- heavy governance and OWL inspection stays out of the request hot path

## Client Facade Boundaries (Active Direction)

`Seocho` should stay a public facade, not a second home for canonical engine
logic.

- `seocho/client.py`
  - public SDK facade and orchestration entrypoints
- `seocho/http_transport.py`
  - HTTP request/response wrapping and exception mapping
- `seocho/client_artifacts.py`
  - ontology-to-runtime-artifact bridge helpers
- `seocho/query/*`, `seocho/agent/*`, `seocho/ontology_*`
  - canonical engine subdomains used by the facade

Canonical direction:

- keep the constructor and top-level SDK calls stable
- move HTTP transport, ontology bridge helpers, and local engine internals out
  of `client.py` over incremental slices
- avoid adding new canonical business logic directly to the facade

### Data Plane

- data ingestion and extraction pipeline
- SHACL-like rule inference and validation
- graph loading/query execution on DozerDB

Primary modules:

- `seocho/rules.py` — canonical rule inference/validation (shared by SDK + server)
- `seocho/index/pipeline.py` — canonical indexing pipeline with rule + embedding support
- `seocho/index/linker.py` — canonical embedding-based entity linker
- `extraction/pipeline.py` — legacy batch pipeline
- `extraction/rule_constraints.py` — re-export shim to `seocho.rules`
- `extraction/vector_store.py` — adapter shim to `seocho.store.vector`
- `extraction/graph_loader.py`

## Benchmark Contract (Active Direction)

Performance and quality must be measured in two tracks:

- `private finance corpus`
  - ingestion, graph construction, finance-domain QA
- `GraphRAG-Bench`
  - retrieval, evidence quality, reasoning

Measurement order:

1. SEOCHO local SDK baseline
2. SEOCHO runtime baseline
3. peer baselines

That rule prevents us from confusing deployment overhead with canonical engine
quality. See `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`.

## End-to-End Data Flow

```
[External Data]
       │
       ▼
  DataSource (CSV/JSON/Parquet/API)
       │
       ▼
  OntologyPromptBridge (ontology → LLM prompt injection)
       │
       ▼
  EntityExtractor (LLM-based entity/relationship extraction)
       │
       ▼
  EntityLinker (LLM-based entity resolution)
       │
       ▼
  EntityDeduplicator (embedding similarity dedup)
       │
       ▼
  RuleConstraints (SHACL-like inference + validation)
       │
       ▼
  DatabaseManager (Neo4j DB creation + schema + load)
       │
       ▼
  AgentFactory (DB별 전용 Agent 생성)
       │
       ▼
  User Question → Router/DebateOrchestrator → AgentPool → SharedMemory → Supervisor → Answer
```

## Query-Time Semantic Flow (New)

For graph QA with hard entity disambiguation requirements:

```
User Question
    │
    ▼
Semantic Layer
- extract question entities
- fulltext lookup on DozerDB/Neo4j
- semantic dedup/disambiguation with label hints
    │
    ▼
RouterAgent
    ├── LPGAgent (property graph neighborhood path)
    └── RDFAgent (RDF/ontology-oriented path)
             │
             ▼
AnswerGenerationAgent (final synthesis)
```

Why this path exists:

- query-time entity mapping is the hardest failure point in graph QA
- fulltext-first lookup improves recall for imperfect user entity strings
- semantic re-ranking + dedup reduces wrong-node selection before Cypher generation

Canonical direction:

- `seocho/query/` is the canonical query engine surface
- local SDK and server runtime should share planner, executor, and answer
  shaping contracts from `seocho/query/*`
- semantic query Phase A now also shares intent, support assessment, strategy
  selection, Cypher validation, and insufficiency contracts from
  `seocho/query/{intent,strategy_chooser,cypher_validator,insufficiency,contracts}.py`
- semantic query Phase B now also shares constraint-slice building and run
  metadata persistence from `seocho/query/{constraints,run_registry}.py`
- semantic query Phase C now also shares entity resolution, route selection,
  LPG/RDF specialists, and answer framing from
  `seocho/query/semantic_agents.py`
- semantic query Phase D now also shares `SemanticAgentFlow` orchestration from
  `seocho/query/semantic_flow.py`; extraction keeps runtime injection and
  compatibility aliases only
- `extraction/*` should keep transport and runtime orchestration concerns, not
  grow a second query engine

Server entrypoint direction:

- `runtime/agent_server.py` is the FastAPI transport shell
- `runtime/server_runtime.py` owns shared runtime service composition
- routers should prefer lazy service getters over eager singleton boot at import

## Extraction Cleanup Classification (Current)

The extraction layer is being reduced toward transport, provisioning, and
compatibility roles.

- shim now:
  - `extraction/rule_constraints.py`
  - `extraction/vector_store.py`
- compatibility alias now:
  - `extraction/agent_server.py`
  - `extraction/agent_readiness.py`
  - `extraction/middleware.py`
  - `extraction/memory_service.py`
  - `extraction/public_memory_api.py`
  - `extraction/server_runtime.py`
  - `extraction/policy.py`
- keep as transport/composition:
  - `runtime/agent_server.py`
  - `runtime/agent_readiness.py`
  - `runtime/middleware.py`
  - `runtime/memory_service.py`
  - `runtime/public_memory_api.py`
  - `runtime/server_runtime.py`
  - `runtime/runtime_ingest.py`
- keep as compatibility caller over canonical seam:
  - `extraction/pipeline.py`
- compatibility alias now:
  - `extraction/runtime_ingest.py`
- canonical helper seams now shared with runtime ingest:
  - `seocho/index/runtime_memory.py`
  - `seocho/index/runtime_artifacts.py`
- migrate later:
  - remaining runtime ingest orchestration beyond extraction/linking setup

Shared ingestion seam:

- `seocho/index/extraction_engine.py`
  - canonical extraction prompt rendering
  - canonical linking prompt rendering
  - canonical graph payload normalization
  - reused by SDK indexing, extraction compatibility pipeline, and runtime
    ingest prompt-driven extraction/linking setup

## Intent-First Graph-RAG Contract (Active Direction)

Semantic QA and memory-first answering should move toward an explicit
intent-to-evidence contract:

- `intent_id`
- `required_relations`
- `required_entity_types`
- `focus_slots`
- `selected_triples`
- `slot_fills`
- `missing_slots`
- provenance and confidence

This keeps graph retrieval accountable to answerability rather than vague local
relevance.

Primary implementation anchors:

- `seocho/query/intent.py`
- `seocho/query/strategy_chooser.py`
- `seocho/query/cypher_validator.py`
- `seocho/query/insufficiency.py`
- `extraction/semantic_query_flow.py` as the compatibility surface during migration
- `runtime/memory_service.py`
- `runtime/public_memory_api.py`
- `seocho/types.py`

Reference design brief: `docs/GRAPH_RAG_AGENT_HANDOFF_SPEC.md`

## Enterprise Vocabulary Layer (Planned Direction)

To reduce keyword brittleness in graph retrieval, SEOCHO adopts a governed vocabulary layer derived from extraction and SHACL-like artifacts.

Control-plane responsibilities:

- maintain vocabulary lifecycle (`draft -> approved -> deprecated`)
- enforce approval policy and promotion gates before runtime exposure
- manage global baseline vocabulary and workspace-scoped override policy

Data-plane responsibilities:

- generate vocabulary candidates from entity extraction/linking results
- enrich candidate terms from SHACL-like rule artifacts (labels, aliases, value constraints)
- persist artifacts for review and provenance audit

Runtime contract:

- resolve query terms using approved vocabulary (global baseline + `workspace_id` override)
- apply lightweight expansion/disambiguation only in hot path
- keep heavy ontology reasoning in offline governance path (`owlready2`)

Offline ontology governance operators should prefer the SDK CLI surface:

- `seocho ontology check --schema schema.jsonld`
- `seocho ontology export --schema schema.jsonld --format shacl --output shacl.json`
- `seocho ontology diff --left old.jsonld --right new.jsonld`
- `seocho ontology inspect-owl --source ontology.owl`

## Three Execution Modes

### 1. Legacy Router Mode (`POST /run_agent`)

```
User → Router → {GraphAgent, VectorAgent, WebAgent, TableAgent} → Supervisor → Answer
```

- Legacy static 7-agent pipeline.
- The Router delegates the query to exactly 1 specialist agent.
- Sequential hand-off chain execution.

### 2. Parallel Debate Mode (`POST /run_debate`)

```
User → DebateOrchestrator → [Agent_db1 ∥ Agent_db2 ∥ ... ∥ Agent_dbN] → SharedMemory → Supervisor → Answer
```

- All database-bound agents execute concurrently via `asyncio.gather()`.
- Each agent stores its isolated conclusion in Shared Memory.
- A Supervisor Agent aggregates and synthesizes the final comprehensive answer.
- Fault Isolated: If one agent fails, the Supervisor synthesizes using the remaining successful agent answers.
- Runtime payload includes per-database readiness metadata (`agent_statuses`) and overall degraded flag (`degraded`) for safe UI/ops handling.

### 3. Semantic Graph QA Mode (`POST /run_agent_semantic`)

```
User → SemanticLayer → RouterAgent → {LPGAgent | RDFAgent | both} → AnswerGenerationAgent
```

- 4-agent model aligned with current query-time disambiguation requirement
- semantic layer performs:
  - question entity extraction
  - fulltext index candidate search
  - contains-based fallback search
  - optional ontology-hint alias/label boost from offline artifact (`output/ontology_hints.json`)
  - lightweight semantic dedup/disambiguation
- frontend can pin candidate mappings and resend as `entity_overrides`
- route policy:
  - RDF hints (`rdf`, `owl`, `shacl`, `sparql`) → RDFAgent
  - default → LPGAgent
  - mixed hints → hybrid path (both agents)

## Key Patterns

### DatabaseRegistry (Global Singleton)

```python
from config import db_registry

db_registry.register("mydb01")         # 등록
db_registry.is_valid("mydb01")         # 검증 (True)
db_registry.list_databases()           # 사용자 DB 목록 (system/neo4j 제외)
```

- DB Name Validation: `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*$` (Must start with a letter, alphanumeric only)
- `VALID_DATABASES` (legacy fallback lookup) statically references `db_registry._databases`.

### GraphRegistry (Control Plane)

```python
from config import graph_registry

graph_registry.list_graph_ids()       # graph IDs used by debate/runtime APIs
graph_registry.get_graph("kgfibo")    # uri/database/ontology/vocabulary descriptor
```

- Graph targets are loaded from `SEOCHO_GRAPH_REGISTRY_FILE`.
- Each `graph_id` can point to a different Neo4j or DozerDB instance.
- Debate mode fans out by `graph_id`, not only by database name.

### AgentFactory (Closure-bound Tools)

```python
factory = AgentFactory(neo4j_connector)
agent = factory.create_graph_agent(graph_target, schema_info)
```

- Each agent's query tool is closure-bound directly to a specific graph target context.
- Automatic SharedMemory cache integration (via `RunContextWrapper`).

### SharedMemory (Request-scoped)

```python
memory = SharedMemory()
memory.cache_query_result("kgnormal", "MATCH (n) RETURN n", "[...]")
memory.get_cached_query("kgnormal", "MATCH (n) RETURN n")  # cache hit
memory.put("agent_result:kgnormal", "answer text")
memory.get_all_results()  # Supervisor용 전체 결과
```

- Request-scoped: Exactly 1 instance instantiated per API request.
- Implements MD5 hashing on Cypher queries for rapid caching lookups.

### OntologyPromptBridge

```python
from ontology.base import Ontology
from ontology_prompt_bridge import OntologyPromptBridge

ontology = Ontology.from_yaml("conf/schemas/fibo.yaml")
bridge = OntologyPromptBridge(ontology)
context = bridge.render_extraction_context()
# → {"entity_types": "- Organization: ...", "relationship_types": "...", "ontology_name": "FIBO"}
```

- Converts `NodeDefinition` and `RelationshipDefinition` from the Ontology YAML into native LLM prompt variables.
- The `default.yaml` prompt dynamically switches between static mapping vs dynamic logic using standard `{% if ontology_name %}` templating blocks.

## Frontend Trace vs Opik

두 시스템의 역할이 명확히 분리되어 있습니다:

### Custom Platform (Interactive UI)
- **Purpose**: Interactive operational chat UX + semantic disambiguation override loop.
- **Location**: `evaluation/server.py` + `evaluation/static/*` (listening on port 8501).
- **Tracing**: The backend streams `trace_steps` and `ui_payload` to the frontend for real-time visualization.
- **Capabilities**: Allows the user to select semantic candidates, trigger override re-queries, and maintains strict session-level dialog history.
- **Additional capability**: Supports direct raw-text ingestion (`Ingest Raw`) before query execution.

### Opik (Optional Team Exporter)
- **Purpose**: Team-grade eval, debugging, LLM scoring, and deep agent visualization.
- **Location**: `http://localhost:5173` (opt-in via `docker compose --profile opik up -d`).
- **Tracing**: activated only when the trace backend is explicitly set to `opik`; otherwise runtime traces can stay local in JSONL or console form.
- **Capabilities**: Captures parent-child span trees, exact LLM costs/latency, custom datasets & experiments, and prompt scoring metrics.

### Opik Span Tree (Debate Pattern)

Opik에서 Debate 패턴은 다음과 같은 span hierarchy로 표현됩니다:

```
agent_server.run_debate                          [tags: debate-mode]
  └─ debate.run_debate                           [phase: orchestration, agent_count: N]
       ├─ debate.run_single_agent                [phase: fan-out, db: kgnormal]
       │    └─ (OpenAI chat.completions.create)  [auto-traced]
       ├─ debate.run_single_agent                [phase: fan-out, db: kgfibo]
       │    └─ (OpenAI chat.completions.create)  [auto-traced]
       └─ debate.supervisor_synthesis            [phase: synthesis]
            └─ (OpenAI chat.completions.create)  [auto-traced]
```

Each individual recursive span carries heavy `metadata` (e.g., db_name, agent_name, phase) and diagnostic `tags` allowing rapid filtering and auditing within the Opik Dashboard UI.

### Frontend Trace Topology

```
FANOUT (yellow) ─┬─ DEBATE: Agent_kgnormal (blue)
                 ├─ DEBATE: Agent_kgfibo   (blue)
                 └─ DEBATE: Agent_xxx      (blue)
                          │
                 COLLECT (orange) ← 모든 DEBATE
                          │
                 SYNTHESIS: Supervisor (green)
```

Edge routing in the UI is rendered strictly via the `metadata.parent` (for the fan-out trajectory) and `metadata.sources` (for the collection synthesis loop) properties on the payload.
