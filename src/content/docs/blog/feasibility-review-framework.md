This document operationalizes philosophy-level decisions into an execution review framework for multi-role experts.

## Purpose

- verify whether SEOCHO philosophy can be delivered with current stack and constraints
- identify blocking risks before implementation scales
- define measurable Go/Conditional Go/No-Go criteria

## Required Panel Roles

- frontend engineer
- backend engineer
- software architect
- software engineer (application/platform)
- database engineer (DBA)

## Review Dimensions

Evaluate each dimension with `Green`, `Amber`, or `Red`.

| Dimension | Key Question | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Semantic Layer Viability | Can SHACL-like rules be inferred, validated, and promoted safely? | `/rules/assess`, profile/export results |
| Ontology Governance | Are `.ttl`/hint/profile artifacts versioned and rollback-safe? | git history, ADR, release notes |
| Agent Topology Integrity | Is graph-instance <-> graph-agent 1:1 mapping enforced? | runtime config, orchestration traces |
| Router Allocation Quality | Does router choose target graphs with explainable confidence? | routing metadata, override logs |
| DAG Contract Reliability | Does UI render topology only from backend contract fields? | trace payload schema tests |
| Data/Query Safety | Are query surfaces policy-gated and workspace-safe? | policy checks, audit traces |
| Cost/Latency Envelope | Can end-to-end flow stay within target SLO and budget? | p95 latency, token/runtime cost |

## Role-Specific Checklists

### Frontend Engineer

- topology lines are rendered from backend metadata (`node_id`, `parent_id`, `parent_ids`)
- no heuristic-only lineage reconstruction for production path
- fallback UI behavior is defined when topology is partial/missing
- trace canvas scales under fan-out/fan-in orchestration load

### Backend Engineer

- trace schema contract is deterministic and versioned
- router/semantic flows expose confidence and decision reasons
- policy checks guard runtime endpoints consistently
- `workspace_id` is propagated through all runtime contracts

### Software Architect

- control plane and data plane boundaries remain explicit
- ontology governance path stays offline-heavy (not hot-path blocking)
- ADR coverage exists for major orchestration/contract changes
- failure modes have deterministic degradation strategy

### Software Engineer (Platform/Application)

- end-to-end flow is testable with reproducible fixtures
- operational runbooks cover ingest -> rules -> routing -> response
- observability fields are sufficient for incident replay
- integration contracts across modules avoid hidden side effects

### Database Engineer (DBA)

- DozerDB/Neo4j compatibility assumptions are validated continuously
- fulltext/index lifecycle is automated and idempotent
- constraint/export plans are reviewed before governance promotion
- query patterns are bounded for performance and operational safety

## Decision Rubric

- `Go`: no `Red`, and at most 2 `Amber`, with owners/dates assigned
- `Conditional Go`: 1 `Red` or 3-4 `Amber`, with mandatory mitigation plan
- `No-Go`: 2+ `Red`, or unresolved safety/governance blocker

## Risk Register Template

| ID | Risk | Severity | Owner Role | Mitigation | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Example: ontology/profile drift | High | Architect | version pin + compatibility test | failed export/readiness |

## 30/60/90 Plan Template

- Day 0-30:
  - enforce schema tests for topology contract
  - baseline `/rules/assess` thresholds and publish pass criteria
- Day 31-60:
  - close confidence/override loop with operator UX and audit export
  - add replay-grade Opik trace dashboards for router/debate/semantic
- Day 61-90:
  - production hardening for index/constraint lifecycle
  - define release gate tying ADR + readiness + SLO checks

## KPI Baseline

- rule readiness pass rate (`ready` ratio) per ingestion batch
- router allocation precision (verified answerable-route ratio)
- semantic disambiguation confidence calibration (override rate vs confidence)
- topology contract compliance (trace payload schema pass rate)
- p95 end-to-end latency by mode (`router`, `debate`, `semantic`)
- incident replay completeness (trace-to-root-cause success ratio)

## Initial Panel Synthesis (2026-02-20)

Decision: `Conditional Go`

Primary reasons:

- philosophy and architecture intent are explicit and well aligned
- SHACL-like readiness and DAG contract directions are implemented
- operational hardening remains for confidence calibration, SLO envelopes, and governance automation

Immediate priorities:

1. treat topology payload schema as a release-blocking contract
2. enforce readiness gates before rule/ontology promotion
3. publish confidence policy for router/semantic fallback behavior
